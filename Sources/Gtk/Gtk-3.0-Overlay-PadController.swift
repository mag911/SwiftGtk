// MARK: - Overlay Class

/// The `OverlayProtocol` protocol exposes the methods and properties of an underlying `GtkOverlay` instance.
/// The default implementation of these can be found in the protocol extension below.
/// For a concrete class that implements these methods and properties, see `Overlay`.
/// Alternatively, use `OverlayRef` as a lighweight, `unowned` reference if you already have an instance you just want to use.
///
/// GtkOverlay is a container which contains a single main child, on top
/// of which it can place “overlay” widgets. The position of each overlay
/// widget is determined by its `GtkWidget`:halign and `GtkWidget`:valign
/// properties. E.g. a widget with both alignments set to `GTK_ALIGN_START`
/// will be placed at the top left corner of the GtkOverlay container,
/// whereas an overlay with halign set to `GTK_ALIGN_CENTER` and valign set
/// to `GTK_ALIGN_END` will be placed a the bottom edge of the GtkOverlay,
/// horizontally centered. The position can be adjusted by setting the margin
/// properties of the child to non-zero values.
/// 
/// More complicated placement of overlays is possible by connecting
/// to the `GtkOverlay`::get-child-position signal.
/// 
/// An overlay’s minimum and natural sizes are those of its main child. The sizes
/// of overlay children are not considered when measuring these preferred sizes.
/// 
/// `` GtkOverlay as GtkBuildable

/// `GtkPadController` is an event controller for the pads found in drawing
/// tablets (The collection of buttons and tactile sensors often found around
/// the stylus-sensitive area).
/// 
/// These buttons and sensors have no implicit meaning, and by default they
/// perform no action, this event controller is provided to map those to
/// `GAction` objects, thus letting the application give those a more semantic
/// meaning.
/// 
/// Buttons and sensors are not constrained to triggering a single action, some
/// `GDK_SOURCE_TABLET_PAD` devices feature multiple "modes", all these input
/// elements have one current mode, which may determine the final action
/// being triggered. Pad devices often divide buttons and sensors into groups,
/// all elements in a group share the same current mode, but different groups
/// may have different modes. See gdk_device_pad_get_n_groups() and
/// gdk_device_pad_get_group_n_modes().
/// 
/// Each of the actions that a given button/strip/ring performs for a given
/// mode is defined by `GtkPadActionEntry`, it contains an action name that
/// will be looked up in the given `GActionGroup` and activated whenever the
/// specified input element and mode are triggered.
/// 
/// A simple example of `GtkPadController` usage, assigning button 1 in all
/// modes and pad devices to an "invert-selection" action:
/// ```
///   GtkPadActionEntry *pad_actions[] = {
///     { GTK_PAD_ACTION_BUTTON, 1, -1, "Invert selection", "pad-actions.invert-selection" },
///     …
///   };

///   …
///   action_group = g_simple_action_group_new ();
///   action = g_simple_action_new ("pad-actions.invert-selection", NULL);
///   g_signal_connect (action, "activate", on_invert_selection_activated, NULL);
///   g_action_map_add_action (G_ACTION_MAP (action_group), action);
///   …
///   pad_controller = gtk_pad_controller_new (window, action_group, NULL);
/// ```
/// 
/// 
/// The actions belonging to rings/strips will be activated with a parameter
/// of type `G_VARIANT_TYPE_DOUBLE` bearing the value of the given axis, it
/// is required that those are made stateful and accepting this `GVariantType`.
